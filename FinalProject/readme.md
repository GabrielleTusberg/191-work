Final Project

## My Process

This was definetly a race start to finish and in the future I would love to prepare. Overall I feel proud of myself that I did finish. I want to thank my professor for that grueling friday and spending four hours in the office with me but it paid off. Now I must continue studying code all summer or next year will be even worse. Thanks for the great semester and much learning. :)
