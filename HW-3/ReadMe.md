HW-3 Monster Project
-----

## What I Set Out To Do
  1. I wanted to understand more about coding
  2. I wanted to troubleshoot and be patient with myself
  3. I wanted to be creative

### References I Utilized
-P5.js References
-HW3 Instructions Repository
-Professors of the Media Arts building for emotional support

#### What Worked/ What Didn't Work

What helped me most was following the p5.js instructions on what all the coordinates stood for in the syntax for each shape I was trying to make.
It also helped to visualize my drawing like a graph. However, most of what I did was guess and guessing instead of thinking too hard helped me play around and continue working on my project versus thinking too hard on what the coordinates should be.

##### The Breakthrough

My breakthrough happened when I just kept scrolling through P5.js references and messing with the shapes.
I started having fun with it once I really started practicing patience with myself and allowed myself to make mistakes.
I also discovered what it's like to make a small coding error. I though about how frustrating that would be if I had more code on my page.
Luckily my mistake was easily found, I had just missed an 'l' on fill.
