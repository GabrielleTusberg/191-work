Goals for Class 4.1
Animation
-----

## What I learned
-I learned how setup and draw are different, setup runs only once while draw runs several times
-How to move an image with code
-How to set variables
-How to map the background color

### What helped
Watching those videos really helped me. Its nice to have a reference to talk you through it when a professor or outside help isn't available.

#### What I struggled with
I mainly struggled with the same things as the last monster assignment which was the math part.
I'm having a difficult time being able to map out an image and knowing where the coordinates should go
which unfortunately hurt my creativity in this assignment.
