HW 5

First Algorithmic Sketch
-----

## What I learned

This weeks assignment was mcuh more difficult than the others. The math is where I struggle.
I am havign a difficult time intertwining the concepts of basic math and coding without feeling brain dead.
Learning code and so many new tools at once was difficult for me to put together.

### What helped

Office hours was the only way I could have gotten through this one. I just needed to sit down with someone and have them go through the steps individually with me to even know where to start.

#### What was cool

While struggeling with the concepts of how it works its still pretty fascinaitng that it does. I am excited to get more creative and really use these tools to create art.
