  HW-6
----
I had a difficult time figuring this one out but I think the more we are going over these tools and code in class the more they are coming together. I did use another students code as a reference to understand how to do it. Once I started trying to incorporate what I already had made and fully start interpretting my own ideas, it actually confused me more. I'm not very proud of the work I did for this assignment, however, I do think I am starting to understand these concepts and figuring out how to problem solve. Looking forward to staring fresh on HW-7.
