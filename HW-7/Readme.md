HW-7

## What I Learned
  I learned how to create a function to call an object. This tool will allow more efficiency when trying to make objects at once and also helps keeping things organized. I also practiced my conditional statments which helped me understand how to incorporate a button with animation when mouse is pressed. I also learned the difference in the function mousePressed to calling mouseIsPressed which doesn't work as well and made my computer spazz out.

## Struggles
  I need to keep practicing all these terms and making them work all together. I'm still having difficuly with putting all these concepts together and knowing where to start.

### Takeaway
  Overall I'm proud of myself for finishing this assignment and glad I was able to edit my sketch from last week and simplify it.
