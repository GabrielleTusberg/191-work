## My Process

I needed a lot of help with understanding classes and using my 3D code last week. I wanted to use the code from last weeks assignment and improve it as well as making the spaceship type things collide. Unfortunately the boxes would not show up and I couldn't figure out why so I just left them to be spheres. This is the most code I have used to far so it was difficult for me to correct my mistakes or typos and find what wasn't working as quickly. The classes did help with knowing in which general area I would need to look. I also copied the inclass code to make the collision happen and have it follow the mouse (had to let go of the mouse idea). I tried to incorporate this code with my code that I already had but with the objects being 3D barely anything was interpreted easily.I did learn a lot more about functions, classes, subproblem solving by doing and conitually using my HW as practice.
