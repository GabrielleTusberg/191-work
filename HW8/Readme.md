## What I Learned
  Classes are new way to organize your code and it helped me visualize things and see what mistakes I was making more clearly. It helped me with the idea of subproblems and where to go next. I also learned about 3D objects and how they are a bit more tricky to rotate.

## Struggles
  I have no idea why the 3D objects fill in with rainbow colors. I orginally just wanted to make spheres with a line type texture to make them look like dandilions but I couldn't figure out how to change the original fill. 

### Takeaway
  I plan on using classes from now on. I think it will make my code easier for me to see.
